## Steps for contributing code to Shell

- [ ] Create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/campaignmonitor/shell/issues) (make sure it doesn't exist already) and be as detailed as possible (screenshots are good), and label it appropriately. It's a good idea to wait a few days for some feedback before writing any code.
- [ ] [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the Shell repository, make your changes, then create a PR back to the Shell `master` branch for review. Your PR title should use the same title as its corresponding GitHub issue but prefixed with the issue number, e.g.:

    > Issue 71: Add a new Helper to remove responsive images

    In the PR description include:

    > This fixes #71.

    Once the PR is merged (let's say the PR is number 72) then add the
    following in the corresponding GitHub issue:

    > Fixed in #72.
- [ ] If suitable for a visual test then create a test, [see here](test/README.md).
- [ ] Make sure all Sass compiles:
  - `cd test`
  - `grunt testShell`
- [ ] Test in all supported browsers, [see here](README.md#browser-support).
- [ ] Passes linting:
  - `cd` into the root of Shell
  - `gulp lint`

  [See here](README.md#linting)
- [ ] Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). The format is always:
  - A H2 heading (`##` in markdown) for the version number plus the date.
  - A list item for each update, each item describes the update and references
    the corresponding Github issue within brackets at the end.

    **An example:**

    ```
    ## 1.3.0 (May 25, 2016)

    * Add a new Helper to remove responsive images (#71)
    * Add PR/Issue templates and `.github` folder (#15)
    ```

*Some of the above tasks will eventually be automated by CI, see: #19.*

## Keep it simple

Shell is written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), which provides a lot of incredibly powerful features. However, Shell does not want to become a platform to showcase Sass' capabilities; all code that comes into Shell should be as simple and CSS-like as possible. In fact we plan to move away from Sass in the not so distant future and use [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) instead.
